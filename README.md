   ```bash
   cd prompt-optimizer
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. If you want to download the latest release, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/natanim-haile/prompt-optimizer/releases) section.

## Usage

Using Prompt Optimizer is straightforward. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Enter your initial prompt in the provided input field.
3. Adjust the settings as needed to optimize your prompt.
4. Click on the "Optimize" button to generate a refined prompt.
5. Review the output and make any additional adjustments.

### Example

Suppose you start with a simple prompt:

```
Tell me about space.
```

After optimization, the tool might suggest:

```
Explain the concept of space, including its dimensions and significance in the universe.
```

This refined prompt is more specific and likely to yield better responses from the LLM.
